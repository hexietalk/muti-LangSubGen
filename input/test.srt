00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,810
In this section of the course, we are not going to talk about coding. Instead,

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:04,480
we're going to talk

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,720
about mindsets. You're learning how to code because maybe you want to build an

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:09,600
app for you and your

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,660
friends or even you might want to build an entire business and replace your 9

6
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:14,720
to 5. Whatever this

7
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,670
is you're trying to achieve, my goal with these following lessons of this

8
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:19,760
chapter is to give you

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,870
the entire mindset that I've acquired in the past six years in order for you to

10
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,280
achieve your goals.

11
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,430
We're going to talk about things like how to turn your idea into a reality as

12
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,480
fast as possible so

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,640
you don't burn out. We're going to talk about marketing principles for you to

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,760
build a profitable

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,480
business and we're going to talk about how to become self-driven, how to easily

16
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:40,880
find

17
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,200
motivation so you want to show up every day and do the work. Let's begin.
